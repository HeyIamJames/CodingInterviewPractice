#add two numbers without using operators

def foo(a, b):
    #perhaps translate to byte strings and use bit shifts
    #perhaps import c handlers and manipulate on low level
    #perhaps i can iterating thorugh a, then b and append some counter to a list and find the len of the list.

    psudo code:
    x = []
        for i in range a:
            append.x
        for i in ranbe b:
            append x.
        len.x
