"""
Given a stream of unsorted integers, find the median element in sorted order at any given time.
So, we will be receiving a continuous stream of numbers in some random order and we donâ€™t know the stream length in advance.
Write a function that finds the median of the already received numbers efficiently at any time.
We will be asked to find the median multiple times.
