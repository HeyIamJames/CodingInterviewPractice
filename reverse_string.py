"""
Given an input string, reverse all the words. 
To clarify, input: “Interviews are awesome!” output: “awesome! are Interviews”. 
Consider all consecutive non-whitespace characters as individual words.
If there are multiple spaces between words reduce them to a single white space. 
Also remove all leading and trailing whitespaces. So, the output for ”   CS degree”,
“CS    degree”, “CS degree   “, or ”   CS   degree   ” are all the same: “degree CS”.
